#### Python Programming Exercises
- 1- Calculating the average of numbers in a list: Create a list of numbers. Then calculate the average of those numbers using sum() and len().
- 2- Removing duplicates from a list: Create a list with duplicate elements. Then remove all duplicates using set().
- 3- Finding the largest and smallest number: Create a list of numbers and use max() and min() to find the largest and smallest number.
- 4- Reverse String: Create a string and use reversed() to reverse it.
- 5- Split a string based on a specific character: Create a string containing a sentence with spaces and use split() to split it into words.
- 6- Convert numbers to strings: Receive an integer from the input and convert it to a string. Use str().
- 7- Reverse a string: Get a string from input and reverse it. (use a combination of str() and [::-1] notation).
- 8- Number of repetitions of a character in a string: Receive a string and another character from the input. Then count the number of repetitions of that character in the string. Use count().
- 9- Convert string to lowercase and uppercase: Get a string from input and convert it to lowercase and uppercase. Use lower() and upper().
- 10- Finding the index of the first occurrence of a character in a string: Receive a string and another character from the input. Then find the index of the first occurrence of that character in the string. Use find().

#### Python class-based Object-Oriented Programming Exercises
- 1- Create a simple class: Create a simple class called "Person" that has properties like name, age, and occupation. Then create instances of this class and set their properties.
- 2- Calculating area and perimeter of a rectangle using class: Create a class called "Rectangle" that has two properties as length and width. Then create two methods named "calculate_area" and "calculate_perimeter" to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
- 3- Inheritance Definition: Create a base class called "Animal" that has properties like name and type. Then create two subclasses named "Dog" and "Cat" that inherit from the "Animal" class and add their own properties.
- 4- Using defined functions in the class: Create a class called "Car" that has properties such as model, year of manufacture, and speed. Then define a method named "start_engine" to start the car engine and create another method named "stop_engine" to turn off the engine.
- 5- Using protected and private properties: Create a class called "BankAccount" that has protected properties for account balance and private properties for account number. Then define methods named "deposit" and "withdraw" that will deposit and withdraw money from the account respectively.
- 6- Simple data structure: Create a class called "Student" that has attributes name and grade and create a method called "display_info" to display the student's information.
- 7- Using protected properties: Create a class called "BankAccount" that has protected properties for the account balance. Then define methods for depositing and withdrawing funds.
- 8- Using private properties: Create a class called "Employee" that has the name and employee number attributes as private. Then create a method to display employee information and use private properties securely.
- 9- Inheritance: Create a base class called "Vehicle" that has properties like speed and color. Then create two subclasses named "Car" and "Bicycle" that inherit from the main class and add your own properties and methods.
- 10- Using the public method: Create a class called "Rectangle" that has length and width properties. Then define a method called "calculate_area" that calculates the area of the rectangle and use it in different objects.
